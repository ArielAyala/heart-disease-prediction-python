# Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. It is based on a dataset that includes various health features and is implemented using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

You can see a demo [here](https://arielayala-heart-disease-prediction-python-app-streamlit-rtie9k.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- Heart disease prediction.
- Data visualization.
- Machine learning models implemented.
- Model performance evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pickle**

## Installation

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArielAyala/heart-disease-prediction-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd heart-disease-prediction-python
```
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
- Linux/macOS: ```source venv/bin/activate```

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command (ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:
```bash
Streamlit run app-streamlit.py
```

### Using Docker
Or just run the app using docker.
You have a ```Dockerfile```, ```docker-compose.yml```, and ```.dockerignore``` file in your project root.

Build and run the Docker image:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
